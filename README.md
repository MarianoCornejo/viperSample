# Viper Sample!
The project structure contains the following:
  - Infraestructure: Here we have the ViperModule file that contains all the base code to start build viper modules and helper classes to use across the project
  - Modules: Here we add each module that we want to build using viper
  - Resources: Images, storyboards, launchscreens and so on
  - Supporting files: Just for the Info.plist
  
There are no dependencies so you can run the project once you clone it, any doubt you can ask me at ing.marianocornejo@gmail.com
